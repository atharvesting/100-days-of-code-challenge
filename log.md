# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 3, 2025

#### **Today's Progress**: 

- Established my goals for this challenge:

```
Learn Python
- Fundamentals
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Machine Learning Principles using Python

Complete MOOC 2025 Python Foundation by University of Helsinki and give the exam

Complete Replit 100DOC course

Create a primitive Web crawler

Create LifeApp MVP
```

- Prepared for the challenge by:
    - Determining my goals and material for this challenge.
    - Forking the repo in GitHub and cloning it to VSCode.
    - Preparing my personalised forked repo.

- Even coded a little bit!

#### **Thoughts:** 
- I am excited to start this challenge and build a habit of programming.
- I recognise this challenge as an opportunity to learn intensively about my interests aided by external accountablity.

### Day 3: July 6, 2025

#### **Today's Progress**: 

- Completed Day 3 of Replit's 100 days of Python (see Tweet link below)
    - inout statements
- Worked on Python MOOC by mooc.fi
    - Print statement formatting using f strings.
