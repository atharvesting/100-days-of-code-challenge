# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 3, 2025

#### **Today's Progress**: 

- Established my goals for this challenge:

```
Learn Python
- Fundamentals
- Data Structures
- Algorithms
- Machine Learning Principles using Python

Complete MOOC 2025 Python Foundation by University of Helsinki and give the exam

Complete Replit 100DOC course

Create a primitive Web crawler

Create LifeApp MVP
```

- Prepared for the challenge by:
    - Determining my goals and material for this challenge.
    - Forking the repo in GitHub and cloning it to VSCode.
    - Preparing my personalised forked repo.

- Even coded a little bit!

#### **Thoughts:** 
- I am excited to start this challenge and build a habit of programming.
- I recognise this challenge as an opportunity to learn intensively about my interests aided by external accountablity.

- Completed Day 1 of Replit's 100 days of Python (see Tweet link below)
    - Learnt multiline printing with print("""___""")
- Worked on Python MOOC by mooc.fi
    - Worked on building functions within functions
    - Learnt more about debugging (Visual debugger in VSCode, Variable view, creating breakpoints)
- Made great progress with the LifeApp
    - worked on the dates and week calculating logic
    - made a primitive progress bar given percentage.
    - learnt more about the utility of relativedelta
    - started with gui for my application, learnt about tkinter windows and how to set one up.
    - learned how to set up a graphical calendar interface and linking date inputs and buttons to other logic functionality.

#### **Thoughts:** 
- There were some challenges involved, such as difficult problems in the MOOC and debugging in my project, but I eventually sorted everything out.
